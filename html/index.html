                Who We Are ?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Millet-e-Islamia High School was established in 2000. Our school provides co-education from UKG to 10th grade, with Urdu as the medium of
                instruction. Despite this, we also focus on English and Telugu to ensure that students excel in all
                fields. In addition to academic education, we impart Islamic teachings to our students, helping them
                succeed in both this world and the hereafter. Computer education is also an integral part of our
                curriculum. Many students who have studied at our school have achieved success and are currently serving
                in various fields.
            </p>
            <p>We focus on each child individually and arrange extra classes to ensure that even weaker
                students can improve their academic performance. Along with education, we emphasize the importance of
                physical activity. To encourage students to excel in sports, we conduct ground activities three times a
                week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). This helps our students stay active and develop a well-rounded
                personality.
